Hello!

I am Maya Prozan and I recently graduated from the
joint program of computer science and design
in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design.

I am interested in human computer interaction and
my passion is to find new ways for technology to
help people in their daily lives.
I practiced doing so from the programming side and
the designing side.

that is my site and you can view it at
